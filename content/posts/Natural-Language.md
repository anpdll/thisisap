# Natural language
From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia

This article is about languages naturally arising in human society. For natural language in computer systems, see [Natural language processing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_language_processing "Natural language processing").

In [neuropsychology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neuropsychology "Neuropsychology"), [linguistics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linguistics "Linguistics"), and [philosophy of language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philosophy_of_language "Philosophy of language"), a **natural language** or **ordinary language** is any [language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Language "Language") that occurs naturally in a [human](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human "Human") community by a process of use, repetition, and [change](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Language_change "Language change"). It can take different forms, typically either a [spoken language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spoken_language "Spoken language") or a [sign language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sign_language "Sign language"). Natural languages are distinguished from [constructed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constructed_language "Constructed language") and [formal languages](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Formal_language "Formal language") such as [those used to program computers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Programming_language "Programming language") or to study [logic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logic "Logic").[\[1\]](#cite_note-john_lyons-1)

Defining natural language
-------------------------



Natural language can be broadly defined as different from

*   artificial and [constructed languages](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constructed_language "Constructed language"), e.g. [computer programming languages](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_programming_language "Computer programming language")
*   constructed [international auxiliary languages](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_auxiliary_language "International auxiliary language")
*   non-human [communication systems in nature](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biocommunication_\(science\) "Biocommunication (science)") such as [whale and other marine mammal vocalizations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Whale_vocalization "Whale vocalization") or [honey bees](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Honey_bee "Honey bee")' [waggle dance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Waggle_dance "Waggle dance").[\[2\]](#cite_note-animalwise-2)

All [varieties](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Variety_\(linguistics\) "Variety (linguistics)") of [world languages](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_language "World language") are natural languages, including those that are associated with [linguistic prescriptivism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linguistic_prescriptivism "Linguistic prescriptivism") or [language regulation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Language_regulation "Language regulation"). ([Nonstandard dialects](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nonstandard_dialect "Nonstandard dialect") can be viewed as a [wild type](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wild_type "Wild type") in comparison with [standard languages](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standard_language "Standard language").) An [official language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Official_language "Official language") with a regulating academy such as [Standard French](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standard_French "Standard French"), overseen by the [Académie Française](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acad%C3%A9mie_Fran%C3%A7aise "Académie Française"), is classified as a natural language (e.g. in the field of [natural language processing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_language_processing "Natural language processing")), as its prescriptive aspects do not make it constructed enough to be a constructed language or controlled enough to be a [controlled natural language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Controlled_natural_language "Controlled natural language").

Controlled languages
--------------------



Controlled natural languages are subsets of natural languages whose grammars and dictionaries have been restricted in order to reduce [ambiguity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ambiguity "Ambiguity") and complexity. This may be accomplished by decreasing usage of [superlative](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparison_\(grammar\) "Comparison (grammar)") or [adverbial](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adverbial "Adverbial") forms, or [irregular verbs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Irregular_verbs "Irregular verbs"). Typical purposes for developing and implementing a controlled natural language are to aid understanding by non-native speakers or to ease computer processing. An example of a widely-used controlled natural language is [Simplified Technical English](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simplified_Technical_English "Simplified Technical English"), which was originally developed for [aerospace](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aerospace_engineering "Aerospace engineering") and [avionics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Avionics "Avionics") industry manuals.

International constructed languages
-----------------------------------



Being constructed, [International auxiliary languages](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_auxiliary_language "International auxiliary language") such as [Esperanto](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Esperanto "Esperanto") and [Interlingua](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interlingua "Interlingua") are not considered natural languages, with the possible exception of true native speakers of such languages.[\[3\]](#cite_note-Gopsill,_F._P._1990-3) Natural languages evolve, through fluctuations in vocabulary and syntax, to incrementally improve human communication. In contrast, Esperanto was created by Polish ophthalmologist [L. L. Zamenhof](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/L._L._Zamenhof "L. L. Zamenhof") in the late 19th century.

Some natural languages have become organically "standardized" through the synthesis of two or more pre-existing natural languages over a relatively short period of time through the development of a [pidgin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pidgin "Pidgin"), which is not considered a language, into a stable [creole language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Creole_language "Creole language"). A creole such as [Haitian Creole](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haitian_Creole "Haitian Creole") has its own grammar, vocabulary and literature. It is spoken by over 10 million people worldwide and is one of the two official languages of the [Republic of Haiti](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republic_of_Haiti "Republic of Haiti").

As of 1996, there were 350 attested families with one or more [native speakers of Esperanto](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Native_speakers_of_Esperanto "Native speakers of Esperanto"). [Latino sine flexione](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Latino_sine_flexione "Latino sine flexione"), another international auxiliary language, is no longer widely spoken.

*   [Language acquisition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Language_acquisition "Language acquisition") – Process in which a first language is being acquired
*   [Origin of language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Origin_of_language "Origin of language") – Relationship between language and human evolution
*   [Formal semantics (natural language)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Formal_semantics_\(natural_language\) "Formal semantics (natural language)") – Study of meaning in natural languages
*   [Whistled language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Whistled_language "Whistled language") – Emulation of speech by whistling
