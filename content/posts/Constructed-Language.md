# Constructed language
This article is about the creation of planned or artificial human languages. For information about the linguistic field of language planning and policy, see [language planning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Language_planning "Language planning"). For languages that naturally emerge in computer simulations or controlled psychological experiments with humans, see [artificial language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_language "Artificial language"). For languages with a high morpheme-per-word ratio, see [synthetic language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Synthetic_language "Synthetic language").

The Conlang Flag, a symbol of language construction created by subscribers to the CONLANG [mailing list](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mailing_list "Mailing list"), which represents the [Tower of Babel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tower_of_Babel "Tower of Babel") against a rising sun

A **constructed language** (shortened to **conlang**)[\[a\]](#cite_note-1) is a [language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Language "Language") whose [phonology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phonology "Phonology"), [grammar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grammar "Grammar"), [orthography](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orthography "Orthography"), and [vocabulary](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vocabulary "Vocabulary"), instead of having developed [naturally](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_language "Natural language"), are consciously devised for some purpose, which may include being devised for a [work of fiction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fiction "Fiction"). A constructed language may also be referred to as an **artificial**, **planned** or **invented language**, or (in some cases) a **[fictional language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fictional_language "Fictional language")**. _Planned languages_ (or **engineered languages**/**engelangs**) are languages that have been purposefully designed; they are the result of deliberate, controlling intervention and are thus of a form of _[language planning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Language_planning "Language planning")_.[\[1\]](#cite_note-2)

There are many possible reasons to create a constructed language, such as to ease human [communication](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Communication "Communication") (see [international auxiliary language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_auxiliary_language "International auxiliary language") and [code](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Code "Code")); to give [fiction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fiction "Fiction") or an associated constructed setting an added layer of realism; for experimentation in the fields of [linguistics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linguistics "Linguistics"), [cognitive science](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cognitive_science "Cognitive science"), and [machine learning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machine_learning "Machine learning"); for [artistic creation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artistic_language "Artistic language"); for fantasy [role-playing games](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Role-playing_game "Role-playing game"); and for [language games](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Language_game "Language game"). Some people may also make constructed languages as a [hobby](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hobby "Hobby"), or in connection to [worldbuilding](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Worldbuilding "Worldbuilding").

The expression _planned language_ is sometimes used to indicate international auxiliary languages and other languages designed for actual use in human communication. Some prefer it to the adjective _artificial_, as this term may be perceived as pejorative. Outside [Esperanto](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Esperanto "Esperanto") [culture](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Esperanto_culture "Esperanto culture"),[\[b\]](#cite_note-3) the term [language planning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Language_planning "Language planning") means the prescriptions given to a natural language to standardize it; in this regard, even a "natural language" may be artificial in some respects, meaning some of its words have been crafted by conscious decision. [Prescriptive grammars](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linguistic_prescription "Linguistic prescription"), which date to ancient times for [classical languages](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classical_language "Classical language") such as [Latin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Latin "Latin") and [Sanskrit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sanskrit "Sanskrit"), are rule-based codifications of natural languages, such codifications being a middle ground between naïve natural selection and development of language and its explicit construction. The term _glossopoeia_ is also used to mean language construction, particularly construction of [artistic languages](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artistic_language "Artistic language").[\[2\]](#cite_note-higley2007-4)

Conlang speakers are rare. For example, the [Hungarian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hungary "Hungary") [census](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Census "Census") of 2011 found 8,397 speakers of [Esperanto](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Esperanto "Esperanto"),[\[3\]](#cite_note-5) and the census of 2001 found 10 of [Romanid](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Romanid "Romanid"), two each of [Interlingua](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interlingua "Interlingua") and [Ido](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ido "Ido") and one each of [Idiom Neutral](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Idiom_Neutral "Idiom Neutral") and [Mundolinco](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mundolinco "Mundolinco").[\[4\]](#cite_note-6) The [Russian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russia "Russia") census of 2010 found that in Russia there were about 992 speakers of Esperanto (the 120th most common) and nine of the [Esperantido](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Esperantido "Esperantido") [Ido](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ido "Ido").[\[5\]](#cite_note-7)

Planned, constructed, artificial
--------------------------------



The terms "planned", "constructed", "invented", "fictional",[\[6\]](#cite_note-8) and "artificial" are used differently in some traditions. For example, few speakers of [Interlingua](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interlingua "Interlingua") consider their language artificial, since they assert that it has no invented content: Interlingua's vocabulary is taken from a small set of natural languages, and its grammar is based closely on these source languages, even including some degree of irregularity; its proponents prefer to describe its vocabulary and grammar as standardized rather than artificial or constructed. Similarly, [Latino sine flexione](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Latino_sine_flexione "Latino sine flexione") (LsF) is a simplification of Latin from which the [inflections](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflection "Inflection") have been removed. As with Interlingua, some prefer to describe its development as "planning" rather than "constructing". Some speakers of [Esperanto](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Esperanto "Esperanto") and [Esperantidos](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Esperantido "Esperantido") also avoid the term "artificial language" because they deny that there is anything "unnatural" about the use of their language in human communication.\[_[citation needed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed "Wikipedia:Citation needed")_\]

By contrast, some philosophers\[_[according to whom?](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Manual_of_Style/Words_to_watch#Unsupported_attributions "Wikipedia:Manual of Style/Words to watch")_\] have argued that all human languages are conventional or artificial. [François Rabelais](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fran%C3%A7ois_Rabelais "François Rabelais")'s fictional giant Pantagruel, for instance, said: "It is a misuse of terms to say that we have natural language; languages _exist_ through arbitrary institutions and the conventions of peoples. Voices, as the dialecticians say, don't signify naturally, but capriciously."[\[7\]](#cite_note-9)

Furthermore, fictional or experimental languages can be considered _naturalistic_ if they model real world languages. For example, if a naturalistic conlang is derived _a posteriori_ from another language (real or constructed), it should imitate natural processes of [phonological](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phonology "Phonology"), [lexical](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lexicon "Lexicon"), and [grammatical](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grammar "Grammar") change. In contrast with languages such as Interlingua, naturalistic fictional languages are not usually intended for easy learning or communication. Thus, naturalistic fictional languages tend to be more difficult and complex. While Interlingua has simpler grammar, syntax, and orthography than its source languages (though more complex and irregular than Esperanto or its descendants), naturalistic fictional languages typically mimic behaviors of natural languages like [irregular verbs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Irregular_verbs "Irregular verbs") and nouns, and complicated phonological processes.\[_[original research?](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:No_original_research "Wikipedia:No original research")_\]

In terms of purpose, most constructed languages can broadly be divided into:

*   _[Engineered languages](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Engineered_language "Engineered language")_ (_engelangs_), further subdivided into logical languages (_loglangs_), [philosophical languages](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philosophical_language "Philosophical language") and [experimental languages](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Experimental_language "Experimental language"), devised for experimentation in [logic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logic "Logic"), [philosophy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philosophy "Philosophy"), or [linguistics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linguistics "Linguistics");
*   _[Auxiliary languages](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_auxiliary_language "International auxiliary language")_ (_auxlangs_) or _IALs_ (for _International Auxiliary Languages_), devised for interlinguistic or international communication;
*   _[Artistic languages](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artistic_language "Artistic language")_ (_artlangs_), devised to create aesthetic pleasure or humorous effect (_secret languages_ and _mystical languages_ are also usually classified as artistic languages).[\[8\]](#cite_note-:0-10)

The boundaries between these categories are by no means clear.[\[9\]](#cite_note-11) A constructed language could easily fall into more than one of the above categories. A logical language created for [aesthetic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aesthetics "Aesthetics") reasons would also be classifiable as an artistic language; one created with philosophical motives could include being used as an auxiliary language. There are no rules, either inherent in the process of language construction or externally imposed, that would limit a constructed language to fitting only one of the above categories.

A constructed language can have native speakers if young children learn it from parents who speak it fluently. According to _[Ethnologue](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethnologue "Ethnologue")_, there are "200–2000 [who speak Esperanto as a first language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Native_Esperanto_speakers "Native Esperanto speakers")". A member of the [Klingon Language Institute](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Klingon_Language_Institute "Klingon Language Institute"), [d'Armond Speers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/D%27Armond_Speers "D'Armond Speers"), attempted to raise his son as a native (bilingual with English) [Klingon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Klingon_language "Klingon language") speaker.[\[10\]](#cite_note-12)\[_[verification needed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Verifiability "Wikipedia:Verifiability")_\]

As soon as a constructed language has a community of fluent speakers, especially if it has numerous native speakers, it begins to evolve and hence loses its constructed status. For example, [Modern Hebrew](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modern_Hebrew "Modern Hebrew") and its pronunciation norms were developed from existing traditions of [Hebrew](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hebrew "Hebrew"), such as [Mishnaic Hebrew](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mishnaic_Hebrew "Mishnaic Hebrew") and [Biblical Hebrew](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biblical_Hebrew "Biblical Hebrew") following a general [Sephardic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sephardic "Sephardic") pronunciation, rather than engineered from scratch, and has undergone considerable changes since the state of [Israel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israel "Israel") was founded in 1948 (Hetzron 1990:693).\[_[citation not found](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Template:Harvard_citation_documentation#Wikilink_to_citation_does_not_work "Template:Harvard citation documentation")_\] However, linguist [Ghil'ad Zuckermann](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ghil%27ad_Zuckermann "Ghil'ad Zuckermann") argues that Modern Hebrew, which he terms "Israeli", is a Semito-European hybrid based not only on Hebrew but also on [Yiddish](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yiddish "Yiddish") and other languages spoken by revivalists.[\[11\]](#cite_note-13) Zuckermann therefore endorses the translation of the Hebrew Bible into what he calls "Israeli".[\[12\]](#cite_note-14) [Esperanto](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Esperanto "Esperanto") as a living spoken language has evolved significantly from the prescriptive blueprint published in 1887, so that modern editions of the _Fundamenta Krestomatio_, a 1903 collection of early texts in the language, require many footnotes on the syntactic and lexical differences between early and modern Esperanto.[\[13\]](#cite_note-15)

Proponents of constructed languages often have many reasons for using them. The famous but disputed [Sapir–Whorf hypothesis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linguistic_relativity "Linguistic relativity") is sometimes cited; this claims that the language one speaks influences the way one thinks. Thus, a "better" language should allow the speaker to think more clearly or intelligently or to encompass more points of view; this was the intention of [Suzette Haden Elgin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suzette_Haden_Elgin "Suzette Haden Elgin") in creating [Láadan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/L%C3%A1adan "Láadan"), a feminist language[\[14\]](#cite_note-foer-2012-16) embodied in her [feminist science fiction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feminist_science_fiction "Feminist science fiction") series _[Native Tongue](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Native_Tongue_\(Suzette_Haden_Elgin_novel\) "Native Tongue (Suzette Haden Elgin novel)")_.[\[15\]](#cite_note-17) Constructed languages have been included in [standardized tests](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standardized_test "Standardized test") such as the [SAT](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SAT "SAT"), where they were used to test the applicant's ability to infer and apply grammatical rules.[\[16\]](#cite_note-18)[\[17\]](#cite_note-19) By the same token, a constructed language might also be used to _restrict_ thought, as in [George Orwell](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Orwell "George Orwell")'s [Newspeak](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newspeak "Newspeak"), or to _simplify_ thought, as in [Toki Pona](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toki_Pona "Toki Pona"). However, linguists such as [Steven Pinker](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steven_Pinker "Steven Pinker") argue that ideas exist independently of language. For example, in the book _[The Language Instinct](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Language_Instinct "The Language Instinct")_, Pinker states that children spontaneously re-invent slang and even grammar with each generation. These linguists argue that attempts to control the range of human thought through the reform of language would fail, as concepts like "freedom" will reappear in new words if the old words vanish.

Proponents claim a particular language makes it easier to express and understand concepts in one area, and more difficult in others. An example can be taken from the way various [programming languages](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Programming_language "Programming language") make it easier to write certain kinds of programs and harder to write others.

Another reason cited for using a constructed language is the telescope rule, which claims that it takes less time to first learn a simple constructed language and then a natural language, than to learn only a natural language. Thus, if someone wants to learn English, some suggest learning [Basic English](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basic_English "Basic English") first. Constructed languages like Esperanto and Interlingua are in fact often simpler due to the typical lack of [irregular verbs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regular_and_irregular_verbs "Regular and irregular verbs") and other grammatical quirks. Some studies have found that learning Esperanto helps in learning a non-constructed language later (see propaedeutic value of Esperanto).

[Codes for constructed languages](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Codes_for_constructed_languages "Codes for constructed languages") include the [ISO 639-2](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_639-2 "ISO 639-2") "`[art](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Codes_for_constructed_languages "Codes for constructed languages")`" for conlangs; however, some constructed languages have their own [ISO 639](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_639 "ISO 639") language codes (e.g. "`eo`" and "`epo`" for [Esperanto](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Esperanto "Esperanto"), "`jbo`" for [Lojban](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lojban "Lojban"), "`ia`" and "`ina`" for [Interlingua](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interlingua "Interlingua"), "`tlh`" for [Klingon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Klingon_language "Klingon language"), "`io`" and "`ido`" for [Ido](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ido "Ido"), "`lfn`" for [Lingua Franca Nova](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lingua_Franca_Nova "Lingua Franca Nova"), and "`tok`" for [Toki Pona](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toki_Pona "Toki Pona")).

One constraint on a constructed language is that if it was constructed to be a natural language for use by fictional foreigners or aliens, as with [Dothraki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dothraki_language "Dothraki language") and [High Valyrian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High_Valyrian "High Valyrian") in the _[Game of Thrones](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Game_of_Thrones "Game of Thrones")_ series, which was adapted from the _[A Song of Ice and Fire](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_Song_of_Ice_and_Fire "A Song of Ice and Fire")_ book series, the language should be easily pronounced by actors, and should fit with and incorporate any fragments of the language already invented by the book's author, and preferably also fit with any personal names of fictional speakers of the language.\[_[original research?](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:No_original_research "Wikipedia:No original research")_\]

_A priori_ and _a posteriori_ languages
---------------------------------------



An _a priori_ (from [Latin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Latin "Latin") _[a priori](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_priori "A priori")_, "from the former") constructed language is one whose features (including vocabulary, grammar, etc.) are not based on an existing language, and an _a posteriori_ language is the opposite.[\[8\]](#cite_note-:0-10) This categorization, however, is not absolute, as many constructed languages may be called _a priori_ when considering some linguistic factors, and at the same time _a posteriori_ when considering other factors.

An _a priori_ language is any constructed language with some features which are not based on existing languages. Instead these features are invented or elaborated to work differently or to allude to different purposes. Some _a priori_ languages are designed to be [international auxiliary languages](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_auxiliary_language "International auxiliary language") that remove what could be considered an unfair learning advantage for native speakers of a source language that would otherwise exist for _a posteriori_ languages. Others, known as [philosophical](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philosophical_language "Philosophical language") or [taxonomic languages](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taxonomic_languages "Taxonomic languages"), try to categorize their vocabulary, either to express an underlying philosophy or to make it easier to recognize new vocabulary. Finally, many [artistic languages](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artistic_languages "Artistic languages"), created for either personal use or for use in a fictional medium, employ consciously constructed grammars and vocabularies, and are best understood as _a priori_.

### _A posteriori_ language



An **_a posteriori_ language** (from [Latin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Latin_language "Latin language") _a posteriori_, "from the latter"), according to French linguist [Louis Couturat](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Louis_Couturat "Louis Couturat"), is any constructed language whose elements are borrowed from or based on existing languages. The term can also be extended to [controlled versions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Controlled_language "Controlled language") of natural languages, and is most commonly used to refer to vocabulary despite other features. Likewise, [zonal auxiliary languages](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zonal_auxiliary_language "Zonal auxiliary language") (auxiliary languages for speakers of a particular language family) are _a posteriori_ by definition.

While most auxiliary languages are _a posteriori_ due to their intended function as a medium of communication, many [artistic languages](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artistic_languages "Artistic languages") are fully _a posteriori_ in design—many for the purposes of [alternate history](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alternate_history "Alternate history"). In distinguishing whether the language is _a priori_ or _a posteriori_, the prevalence and distribution of respectable traits is often the key.

### Ancient linguistic experiments



Grammatical speculation dates from [Classical Antiquity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classical_Antiquity "Classical Antiquity"); for instance, it appears in [Plato](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plato "Plato")'s _[Cratylus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cratylus_\(dialogue\) "Cratylus (dialogue)")_ in Hermogenes's contention that words are not inherently linked to what they refer to; that people apply "a piece of their own voice ... to the thing".

[Athenaeus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Athenaeus "Athenaeus") tells the story[\[18\]](#cite_note-Anths-Deipnos-20) of two figures: Dionysius of Sicily and [Alexarchus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alexarchus_of_Macedon "Alexarchus of Macedon"):

*   Dionysius of Sicily created [neologisms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neologism "Neologism") like _menandros_ "virgin" (from _menei_ "waiting" and _andra_ "husband") for standard Greek _parthenos_; _menekratēs_ "pillar" (from _menei_ "it remains in one place" and _kratei_ "it is strong") for standard _stulos_; and _ballantion_ "javelin" (from _balletai enantion_ "thrown against someone") for standard _akon_.
*   [Alexarchus of Macedon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alexarchus_of_Macedon "Alexarchus of Macedon"), the brother of King [Cassander](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cassander "Cassander") of Macedon, was the founder of the city of [Ouranopolis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ouranopolis "Ouranopolis"). Athenaeus recounts a story told by Heracleides of Lembos that Alexarchus "introduced a peculiar vocabulary, referring to a rooster as a "dawn-crier", a barber as a "mortal-shaver", a drachma as "worked silver", ... and a herald as an _aputēs_ \[from _ēputa_ "loud-voiced"\].

"He \[Alexarchus\] once wrote something ... to the public authorities in Casandreia ... As for what this letter says, in my opinion not even the [Pythian god](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apollo "Apollo") could make sense of it."[\[18\]](#cite_note-Anths-Deipnos-20)

While the mechanisms of grammar suggested by classical philosophers were designed to explain existing languages ([Latin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Latin "Latin"), [Greek](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greek_language "Greek language"), and [Sanskrit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sanskrit "Sanskrit")), they were not used to construct new grammars. Roughly contemporary to Plato, in his descriptive grammar of Sanskrit, [Pāṇini](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/P%C4%81%E1%B9%87ini "Pāṇini") constructed a set of rules for explaining language, so that the text of his grammar may be considered a mixture of natural and constructed language.

### Early constructed languages



[![](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/0/0f/68r.jpg)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:68r.jpg)

Page 68r of the [Voynich manuscript](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voynich_manuscript "Voynich manuscript"). This three-page foldout from the manuscript includes a chart that appears astronomical.

A legend recorded in the seventh-century [Irish](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Irish_language "Irish language") work [Auraicept na n-Éces](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Auraicept_na_n-%C3%89ces "Auraicept na n-Éces") claims that [Fénius Farsaid](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/F%C3%A9nius_Farsaid "Fénius Farsaid") visited [Shinar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shinar "Shinar") after the [confusion of tongues](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confusion_of_tongues "Confusion of tongues"), and he and his scholars studied the various languages for ten years, taking the best features of each to create _in Bérla tóbaide_ ("the selected language"), which he named [_Goídelc_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Old_Irish "Old Irish")—the Irish language. This appears to be the first mention of the concept of a constructed language in literature.

The earliest non-natural languages were considered less "constructed" than "super-natural", mystical, or divinely inspired. The [Lingua Ignota](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lingua_Ignota "Lingua Ignota"), recorded in the 12th century by St. [Hildegard of Bingen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hildegard_of_Bingen "Hildegard of Bingen"), is an example, and apparently the first entirely artificial language.[\[14\]](#cite_note-foer-2012-16) It is a form of private mystical [cant](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cant_\(language\) "Cant (language)") (see also [Enochian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enochian "Enochian")). An important example from Middle-Eastern culture is [Balaibalan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Balaibalan "Balaibalan"), invented in the 16th century.[\[2\]](#cite_note-higley2007-4) [Kabbalistic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kabbalah "Kabbalah") grammatical speculation was directed at recovering the original language spoken by [Adam and Eve](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adam_and_Eve "Adam and Eve") in [Paradise](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paradise "Paradise"), lost in the [confusion of tongues](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confusion_of_tongues "Confusion of tongues"). The first [Christian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christians "Christians") project for an ideal language is outlined in [Dante Alighieri](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dante_Alighieri "Dante Alighieri")'s _[De vulgari eloquentia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/De_vulgari_eloquentia "De vulgari eloquentia")_, where he searches for the ideal [Italian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Italian_language "Italian language") vernacular suited for literature. [Ramon Llull](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ramon_Llull "Ramon Llull")'s _[Ars Magna](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ramon_Llull#Llull's_Art_\(Ars_Magna\) "Ramon Llull")_ was a project of a perfect language with which the infidels could be convinced of the truth of the Christian faith. It was basically an application of [combinatorics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Combinatorics "Combinatorics") on a given set of concepts.[\[19\]](#cite_note-21) During the [Renaissance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Renaissance "Renaissance"), Lullian and Kabbalistic ideas were drawn upon in a magical context, resulting in [cryptographic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cryptography "Cryptography") applications.

### Perfecting language



Renaissance interest in [Ancient Egypt](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ancient_Egypt "Ancient Egypt"), notably the discovery of the _[Hieroglyphica](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hieroglyphica "Hieroglyphica")_ of [Horapollo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Horapollo "Horapollo"), and first encounters with the [Chinese script](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chinese_script "Chinese script") directed efforts towards a perfect written language. [Johannes Trithemius](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Johannes_Trithemius "Johannes Trithemius"), in _Steganographia_ and _Polygraphia_, attempted to show how all languages can be reduced to one. In the 17th century, interest in [magical](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magical_thinking "Magical thinking") languages was continued by the [Rosicrucians](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rosicrucians "Rosicrucians") and [alchemists](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alchemists "Alchemists") (like [John Dee](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Dee_\(mathematician\) "John Dee (mathematician)") and his [Enochian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enochian "Enochian")). [Jakob Boehme](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jakob_Boehme "Jakob Boehme") in 1623 spoke of a "natural language" (_Natursprache_) of the senses.\[_[citation needed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed "Wikipedia:Citation needed")_\]

[Musical languages](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Musical_language "Musical language") from the Renaissance were often tied up with [mysticism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mysticism "Mysticism"), magic and [alchemy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alchemy "Alchemy"), sometimes also referred to as the [language of the birds](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Language_of_the_birds "Language of the birds"). A non-mystic musical language was [Solresol](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solresol "Solresol").

### 17th and 18th century: advent of philosophical languages



The 17th century saw the rise of projects for "philosophical" or "a priori" languages, such as:

*   [Francis Lodwick](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Francis_Lodwick "Francis Lodwick")'s _A Common Writing_ (1647) and _The Groundwork or Foundation laid (or So Intended) for the Framing of a New Perfect Language and a Universal Common Writing_ (1652)
*   Sir [Thomas Urquhart](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_Urquhart "Thomas Urquhart")'s _Ekskybalauron_ (1651) and _Logopandecteision_[\[20\]](#cite_note-22) (1652)
*   [George Dalgarno](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Dalgarno "George Dalgarno")'s _Ars signorum_, 1661
*   [John Wilkins](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Wilkins "John Wilkins")' _[An Essay towards a Real Character, and a Philosophical Language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/An_Essay_towards_a_Real_Character,_and_a_Philosophical_Language "An Essay towards a Real Character, and a Philosophical Language")_, 1668

These early taxonomic conlangs produced systems of [hierarchical classification](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hierarchical_classification "Hierarchical classification") that were intended to result in both spoken and written expression. [Leibniz](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gottfried_Leibniz "Gottfried Leibniz") had a similar purpose for his _lingua generalis_ of 1678, aiming at a lexicon of characters upon which the user might perform calculations that would yield true propositions automatically, as a side-effect developing [binary calculus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binary_combinatory_logic "Binary combinatory logic"). These projects were not only occupied with reducing or modelling grammar, but also with the arrangement of all human knowledge into "characters" or hierarchies, an idea that with the [Enlightenment](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Age_of_Enlightenment "Age of Enlightenment") would ultimately lead to the _[Encyclopédie](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Encyclop%C3%A9die "Encyclopédie")_. Many of these 17th–18th centuries conlangs were [pasigraphies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pasigraphy "Pasigraphy"), or purely written languages with no spoken form or a spoken form that would vary greatly according to the native language of the reader.[\[21\]](#cite_note-einstein1884-23)

Leibniz and the encyclopedists realized that it is impossible to organize human knowledge unequivocally in a tree diagram, and consequently to construct an _a priori_ language based on such a classification of concepts. Under the entry _Charactère_, [D'Alembert](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/D%27Alembert "D'Alembert") critically reviewed the projects of philosophical languages of the preceding century. After the _Encyclopédie_, projects for _a priori_ languages moved more and more to the lunatic fringe.\[_[citation needed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed "Wikipedia:Citation needed")_\] Individual authors, typically unaware of the history of the idea, continued to propose taxonomic philosophical languages until the early 20th century (e.g. [Ro](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ro_\(language\) "Ro (language)")), but most recent [engineered languages](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Engineered_language "Engineered language") have had more modest goals; some are limited to a specific field, like mathematical formalism or calculus (e.g. [Lincos](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lincos_\(artificial_language\) "Lincos (artificial language)") and [programming languages](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Programming_language "Programming language")), others are designed for eliminating [syntactical ambiguity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syntactical_ambiguity "Syntactical ambiguity") (e.g., [Loglan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Loglan "Loglan") and [Lojban](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lojban "Lojban")) or maximizing conciseness (e.g., [Ithkuil](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ithkuil "Ithkuil")[\[14\]](#cite_note-foer-2012-16)).

### 19th and 20th centuries: auxiliary languages



Already in the _[Encyclopédie](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Encyclop%C3%A9die "Encyclopédie")_ attention began to focus on _a posteriori_ auxiliary languages. [Joachim Faiguet de Villeneuve](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joachim_Faiguet_de_Villeneuve "Joachim Faiguet de Villeneuve") in the article on _Langue_ wrote a short proposition of a "laconic" or regularized grammar of [French](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/French_\(language\) "French (language)"). During the 19th century, a bewildering variety of such International Auxiliary Languages (IALs) were proposed, so that [Louis Couturat](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Louis_Couturat "Louis Couturat") and [Léopold Leau](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/L%C3%A9opold_Leau "Léopold Leau") in _Histoire de la langue universelle_ (1903) reviewed 38 projects.

The first of these that made any international impact was [Volapük](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volap%C3%BCk "Volapük"), proposed in 1879 by [Johann Martin Schleyer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Johann_Martin_Schleyer "Johann Martin Schleyer"); within a decade, 283 Volapükist clubs were counted all over the globe. However, disagreements between Schleyer and some prominent users of the language led to schism, and by the mid-1890s it fell into obscurity, making way for [Esperanto](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Esperanto "Esperanto"), proposed in 1887 by [L. L. Zamenhof](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/L._L._Zamenhof "L. L. Zamenhof"), and its [descendants](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Esperantido "Esperantido"). [Interlingua](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interlingua "Interlingua"), the most recent auxlang to gain a significant number of speakers, emerged in 1951, when the [International Auxiliary Language Association](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Auxiliary_Language_Association "International Auxiliary Language Association") published its [Interlingua–English Dictionary](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interlingua%E2%80%93English_Dictionary "Interlingua–English Dictionary") and an accompanying [grammar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interlingua:_A_Grammar_of_the_International_Language "Interlingua: A Grammar of the International Language"). The success of Esperanto did not stop others from trying to construct new auxiliary languages, such as Leslie Jones' [Eurolengo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eurolengo "Eurolengo"), which mixes elements of English and Spanish.

[Loglan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Loglan "Loglan") (1955) and its descendants constitute a pragmatic return to the aims of the _a priori_ languages, tempered by the requirement of usability of an auxiliary language. Thus far, these modern _a priori_ languages have garnered only small groups of speakers.

[Robot Interaction Language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robot_Interaction_Language "Robot Interaction Language") (2010) is a spoken language that is optimized for communication between machines and humans. The major goals of ROILA are that it should be easily learnable by the human user, and optimized for efficient recognition by computer [speech recognition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Speech_recognition "Speech recognition") algorithms.

Artists may use language as a source of creativity in art, poetry, or calligraphy, or as a metaphor to address themes as cultural diversity and the vulnerability of the individual in a globalized world.

Some people prefer however to take pleasure in constructing, crafting a language by a conscious decision for reasons of literary enjoyment or aesthetic reasons without any claim of usefulness. Such [artistic languages](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artistic_language "Artistic language") begin to appear in [Early Modern](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Early_modern_period "Early modern period") literature (in [Pantagruel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gargantua_and_Pantagruel "Gargantua and Pantagruel"), and in [Utopian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Utopia "Utopia") contexts), but they only seem to gain notability as serious projects beginning in the 20th century.[\[2\]](#cite_note-higley2007-4) _[A Princess of Mars](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_Princess_of_Mars "A Princess of Mars")_ (1912) by [Edgar Rice Burroughs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edgar_Rice_Burroughs "Edgar Rice Burroughs") was possibly the first fiction of that century to feature a constructed language. [J. R. R. Tolkien](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J._R._R._Tolkien "J. R. R. Tolkien") developed families of related fictional languages and discussed artistic languages publicly, giving a lecture entitled "_[A Secret Vice](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_Secret_Vice "A Secret Vice")_" in 1931 at a congress. (Orwell's Newspeak is considered a satire of an [international auxiliary language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_auxiliary_language "International auxiliary language") rather than an artistic language proper.)

By the beginning of the first decade of the 21st century, it had become common for [science fiction and fantasy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Speculative_fiction "Speculative fiction") works set in other worlds to feature constructed languages, or more commonly, an extremely limited but defined vocabulary which _suggests_ the existence of a complete language, or whatever portions of the language are needed for the story. Constructed languages are a regular part of the genre, appearing in _[Star Wars](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Star_Wars "Star Wars")_, _[Star Trek](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Star_Trek "Star Trek")_, _[The Lord of the Rings](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Lord_of_the_Rings "The Lord of the Rings")_ ([Elvish](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elvish_languages_\(Middle-earth\) "Elvish languages (Middle-earth)")), _[Stargate SG-1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stargate_SG-1 "Stargate SG-1")_, _[Atlantis: The Lost Empire](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atlantis:_The_Lost_Empire "Atlantis: The Lost Empire"), [Ar Tonelico](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ar_Tonelico "Ar Tonelico")_ ([Hymmnos](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ar_Tonelico#Hymmnos "Ar Tonelico")),[\[22\]](#cite_note-24)[\[23\]](#cite_note-25) _[Game of Thrones](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Game_of_Thrones "Game of Thrones")_ ([Dothraki language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dothraki_language "Dothraki language") and [Valyrian languages](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Valyrian_languages "Valyrian languages")), _[The Expanse](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Expanse_\(TV_series\) "The Expanse (TV series)")_, _[Avatar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Avatar_\(2009_film\) "Avatar (2009 film)")_, _[Dune](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dune_\(franchise\) "Dune (franchise)"),_ and the _[Myst](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Myst "Myst")_ series of computer adventure games.

Ownership of constructed languages
----------------------------------



The matter of whether or not a constructed language can be owned or protected by intellectual property laws, or if it would even be possible to enforce those laws, is contentious.

In a 2015 lawsuit, [CBS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CBS "CBS") and [Paramount Pictures](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paramount_Pictures "Paramount Pictures") challenged a fan film project called Axanar, stating the project infringed upon their intellectual property, which included the [Klingon language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Klingon_language "Klingon language"), among other creative elements. During the controversy, Marc Okrand, the language's original designer expressed doubt as to whether Paramount's claims of ownership were valid.[\[24\]](#cite_note-26)[\[25\]](#cite_note-27)

[David J. Peterson](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_J._Peterson "David J. Peterson"), a linguist who created multiple well-known constructed languages including the [Valyrian languages](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Valyrian_languages "Valyrian languages") and [Dothraki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dothraki_language "Dothraki language"), advocated a similar opinion, saying that "Theoretically, anyone can publish anything using any language I created, and, in my opinion, neither I nor anyone else should be able to do anything about it."[\[26\]](#cite_note-auto-28)

However, Peterson also expressed concern that the respective rights-holders—regardless of whether or not their ownership of the rights is legitimate—would be likely to sue individuals who publish material in said languages, especially if the author might profit from said material.

Furthermore, comprehensive learning material for such constructed languages as [High Valyrian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High_Valyrian "High Valyrian") and Klingon has been published and made freely accessible on the language-learning platform [Duolingo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Duolingo "Duolingo")—but those courses are licensed by the respective copyright holders.[\[26\]](#cite_note-auto-28) Because only a few such disputes have occurred thus far, the legal consensus on ownership of languages remains uncertain.

The [Tasmanian Aboriginal Centre](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tasmanian_Aboriginal_Centre "Tasmanian Aboriginal Centre") claims ownership of [Palawa kani](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palawa_kani "Palawa kani"), an attempted composite reconstruction of up to a dozen extinct Tasmanian indigenous languages, and has asked Wikipedia to remove its page on the project. However, there is no current legal backing for the claim.[\[27\]](#cite_note-29)

Modern conlang organizations
----------------------------



Various papers on constructed languages were published from the 1970s through the 1990s, such as _Glossopoeic Quarterly_, _Taboo Jadoo_, and _The Journal of Planned Languages_.[\[28\]](#cite_note-rosta2007-30) The Conlang Mailing List was founded in 1991, and later split off an AUXLANG mailing list dedicated to international auxiliary languages. In the early to mid-1990s a few conlang-related zines were published as email or websites, such as _Vortpunoj_[\[29\]](#cite_note-vortpunoj-31) and _Model Languages_. The Conlang mailing list has developed a community of [conlangers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_language_inventors "List of language inventors") with its own customs, such as translation challenges and [translation relays](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Translation_relay "Translation relay"),[\[30\]](#cite_note-32) and its own terminology. Sarah Higley reports from results of her surveys that the demographics of the Conlang list are primarily men from North America and western Europe, with a smaller number from Oceania, Asia, the Middle East, and South America, with an age range from thirteen to over sixty; the number of women participating has increased over time.

Later online communities include the [Zompist](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zompist "Zompist") Bulletin Board (ZBB; since 2001) and the Conlanger Bulletin Board. Discussion on these forums includes presentation of members' conlangs and feedback from other members, discussion of natural languages, whether particular conlang features have natural language precedents, and how interesting features of natural languages can be repurposed for conlangs, posting of interesting short texts as translation challenges, and meta-discussion about the philosophy of conlanging, conlangers' purposes, and whether conlanging is an art or a hobby.[\[2\]](#cite_note-higley2007-4) Another 2001 survey by Patrick Jarrett showed an average age of 30.65, with the average time since starting to invent languages 11.83 years.[\[31\]](#cite_note-jarrett2001-33) A more recent thread on the ZBB showed that many conlangers spend a relatively small amount of time on any one conlang, moving from one project to another; about a third spend years on developing the same language.[\[32\]](#cite_note-avg_age-34)

Most modern [conlangers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conlanger "Conlanger") create conlangs as a hobby, for a fictional work, or for [personal fulfillment](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Personal_fulfillment "Personal fulfillment"). Conlangers typically create languages by defining their conlang's [phonology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phonology "Phonology"), [syntax](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syntax "Syntax"), [grammar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grammar "Grammar"), and other properties. Doing so requires at least a rudimentary understanding of [linguistics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linguistics "Linguistics").[\[33\]](#cite_note-35)
